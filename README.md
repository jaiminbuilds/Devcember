# Doing a fun advent calendar

First day of my Advent Calendar of Coding

Came back from Devconnect in November and wanted to explore some exciting tech, realising that I didn't have the required fundamental understanding of many exciting things happening in crypto. This is a way to explore these topics and the technology and understand things from first principles.

It's been a while since I've coded for fun or worked on new projects. LFG ðŸ’ª
