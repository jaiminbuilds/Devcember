## Advent Calendev

### WTF is the point of this repo?

Well, it's been a while since I've coded for fun... that's it really

Coming back from Devconnect in November, I saw a tonne of cool things being built and though there's no better time to expore some of this exciting tech. There is so much awesome shit being built in crypto and the best way to get invovled is to get my hands dirty. This is a way to explore the technology üõ†Ô∏è

My background is mostly data science and ML, I used to be a Python maxi building mostly ML models and data pipelines and all my code was built in Jupyter Notebooks. I've built some frontend (JS & React) before but never gone too deep with smart contract engineering and EVM. That is going to change, this is the point!

It's been a while since I've worked on new projects and coded for the hell of it. LFG üí™

Still building https://www.caddi.fi full time, you can expect to see some overlap with what we're building here and with Caddi üìà

If you are interested in having a chat with me about any of these repos, interested in collaborating, or want to find out more about Caddi then reach out via TG https://t.me/jaimin_building ü´°

## Calendar

I'll log my progress daily in this repo and point to any repos I create during the sprint

### Dec 1st
MEV - Searching Strategies
Did some NodeGuardians quests to learn about storage and Gas Optimizations

Using Blocknative docs
To get an understanding of how Mempools work and how to access transactions that I'm forwarding there.
- https://github.com/jaiminbuilds/mev

### Dec 2nd
Gas monitoring Chrome extension, it uses the blocknative API to monitor gas prices
